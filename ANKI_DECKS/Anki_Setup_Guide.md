# 📇 ANKI SETUP GUIDE FOR KOREAN LEARNING

**Purpose**: Optimize your Anki decks for maximum retention and efficiency

---

## Why Anki for Korean?

Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is THE most effective way to memorize vocabulary long-term. Anki ensures you review words right before you forget them, maximizing retention with minimal time.

**Statistics**: 
- Regular review: ~30% retention after 1 month
- Anki SRS: ~80-90% retention after 1 month

## Deck Structure

### Main Deck Organization:
```
Korean_Learning_2025/
├── Week_01_Foundation
├── Week_02_Foundation
├── Week_03_Foundation
├── ...
├── Week_26_Advanced
└── High_Frequency_Priority (top 1000 words)
```

### Why by Week?
- Easy to track progress
- Can suspend future weeks
- Review by difficulty level
- Clear progression visible

## Card Format (Front & Back)

### RECOMMENDED FORMAT:

**FRONT (Korean sentence with target word)**:
```
저는 학교에 갑니다.
    ----
```
*Underline or bold the target word*

**BACK (English + Details)**:
```
I go to school.
----
가다 (gada) = to go
- Verb
- Present: 가요/갑니다
- Past: 갔어요
- Future: 갈 거예요

Example 2: 친구가 집에 갑니다.
(Friend goes home.)
```

### Why This Format?
1. **Context**: You learn words in sentences (how they're actually used)
2. **Recognition**: Front side tests reading comprehension
3. **Production**: Back side helps you use the word yourself
4. **Examples**: Multiple sentences = better retention

## Grading System (1-2-3-4)

### How to Grade Cards:

**Again (1)** - Red:
- Couldn't remember at all
- Completely forgot
- Wrong answer
→ Card will show again soon (10 min)

**Hard (2)** - Gray:
- Struggled to remember
- Took long time
- Barely got it
→ Shorter interval than "Good"

**Good (3)** - Green:
- Remembered correctly
- Took a few seconds
- Normal recall
→ Standard SRS interval

**Easy (4)** - Blue:
- Instant recognition
- No effort needed
- Too easy
→ Much longer interval

### General Rule:
- **80% of time**: Press "Good" (3)
- **15% of time**: Press "Again" (1) or "Hard" (2)
- **5% of time**: Press "Easy" (4)

**NEVER** press "Easy" just to reduce reviews. Only if truly instant.

## Advanced Tips

### For Efficient Learning:

1. **Use Audio** (highly recommended):
   - Add Naver Dictionary audio to cards
   - Hear pronunciation every time
   - Better for speaking practice

2. **Add Images** (when helpful):
   - Visual memory is powerful
   - Especially for concrete nouns
   - Google images or draw simple icons

3. **Personal Context**:
   - Make sentences about YOUR life
   - "저는 대원입니다" not "저는 _입니다"
   - Personal = memorable

4. **Mnemonics**:
   - Add memory tricks to cards
   - "가다 (to go) = GO-DA!"
   - Weird = memorable

### For Long-term Success:

1. **Never Skip Days**:
   - Anki works through consistency
   - Even 10 min > 0 min
   - Set daily phone reminders

2. **Review Before Sleeping**:
   - Memory consolidates during sleep
   - Review right before bed = better retention

3. **Use Anki Mobile**:
   - Android: AnkiDroid (free)
   - iOS: AnkiMobile ($25, worth it)
   - Sync across devices

4. **Regular Deck Maintenance**:
   - Delete truly useless cards
   - Edit confusing cards
   - Add more examples to difficult cards
   - Unsuspend leeches and try again

## Troubleshooting

### "Too many reviews piling up!"
- **Solution**: Do ALL reviews daily, reduce new cards temporarily
- Never let backlog grow > 100

### "Cards are too easy"
- **Solution**: Increase new cards/day
- Check interval modifier (might increase)

### "Cards are too hard"
- **Solution**: Review previous lessons
- Add more context to cards
- Break down complex words

### "Forgetting everything"
- **Solution**: Learning steps might be too aggressive
- Increase review frequency
- Make sure you understand, not just memorize

### "This takes too long!"
- **Solution**: You're doing too many new cards
- Focus on quality over quantity
- 15 well-learned words > 50 barely-seen words

---

## Integration with Lessons

### Daily Flow:

**Before Lesson**:
- Review yesterday's Anki cards (10-15 min)
- Warm up your brain

**During Lesson**:
- Note new vocabulary
- Mark words for Anki cards

**After Lesson**:
- Create Anki cards immediately (15-20 min)
- Add to today's count
- Do first review right away

**Evening**:
- Review again before bed
- All due cards completed

---

## Statistics to Track

### Check Weekly:
- **Retention Rate**: Aim for 85-90%
  - If lower: Review more carefully, slower new cards
  - If higher: Might be pressing "Good" too liberally

- **Average Review Time**: Aim for 5-10 seconds/card
  - If longer: Cards too complicated, simplify

- **Cards Due Tomorrow**: Should be manageable
  - If too many: Reduce new cards

### Check Monthly:
- **Total Cards**: Should align with curriculum
  - Month 1: ~500 cards
  - Month 2: ~1000 cards
  - Month 6: ~4000 cards

- **Mature Cards**: Should be growing
  - Mature = interval > 21 days
  - These are "learned" words
