## 🎓 Study Tips for Success

### 1. Consistency is Everything
- **30 min daily > 3 hours weekly**
- Set specific times (treat like appointments)
- Never skip two days in a row
- Even sick days: do 10 min of Anki

### 2. Active Learning
- **Don't just read - DO!**
- Write out all exercises
- Say sentences out loud
- Create your own examples
- Teach concepts to others

### 3. Use Your Native Friend
- Practice TODAY's lesson with her
- Ask her to correct pronunciation
- Use new vocabulary in conversation
- Ask cultural questions
- Make it fun and natural

### 4. Immersion Counts
- Podcasts in background = training your ear
- Change phone language to Korean (later)
- Watch Korean content (even if you don't understand)

- Every exposure helps!

### 5. Trust the Process
- You won't understand everything immediately - NORMAL!
- Mistakes are essential for learning
- Confusion means you're at the right difficulty
- Review is more important than new material
- Progress is cumulative
