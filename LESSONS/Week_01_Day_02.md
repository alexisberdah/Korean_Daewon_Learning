## Grammar Point 1: Subject Particle 이/가

### What is a Subject?

The **subject** is the person or thing **performing the action** or **being described** in a sentence. In Korean, we mark it with 이/가.

### Formation Rules:

- Noun ending in **consonant** + **이**
- Noun ending in **vowel** + **가**

**Pattern**: [Subject + 이/가] + [Verb/Adjective]

### Examples:

1. 비가 와요.
   - Translation: Rain is coming / It's raining.
   - Breakdown: 비 (rain-vowel ending) + 가 (subject particle) + 와요 (comes)

2. 친구**가** 좋아요.
   - Translation: (My/The) friend is nice.
   - Breakdown: 친구 (friend-vowel) + 가 + 좋아요 (is good)

3. 학생**이** 많아요.
   - Translation: There are many students.
   - Breakdown: 학생 (student-consonant) + 이 + 많아요 (are many)

4. 날씨**가** 나빠요.
   - Translation: The weather is bad.
   - Breakdown: 날씨 (weather-vowel) + 가 + 나빠요 (is bad)

5. 책**이** 새로워요.
   - Translation: The book is new.
   - Breakdown: 책 (book-consonant) + 이 + 새로워요 (is new)

### When to Use 이/가:

✓ **NEW information** - introducing something new
✓ **Answering "who?" or "what?"** questions
✓ **Emphasis** on the subject doing something
✓ **Existence** (있어요/없어요)

---

## Grammar Point 2: Topic Particle 은/는

### What is a Topic?

The **topic** is what the sentence is **about**. It sets the scene or provides context. Often translates as "as for..." or is the known/old information.

### Formation Rules:

- Noun ending in **consonant** + **은**
- Noun ending in **vowel** + **는**

**Pattern**: [Topic + 은/는] + [Rest of sentence]

### Examples:

1. 저**는** 학생이에요.
   - Translation: I am a student. / As for me, (I) am a student.
   - Breakdown: 저 (I-vowel) + 는 (topic) + 학생이에요 (am a student)

2. 한국**은** 아시아에 있어요.
   - Translation: Korea is in Asia. / As for Korea, (it) is in Asia.
   - Breakdown: 한국 (Korea-consonant) + 은 + 아시아에 있어요 (is in Asia)

3. 날씨**는** 좋아요.
   - Translation: The weather is good. / As for the weather, (it's) good.
   - Breakdown: 날씨 (weather-vowel) + 는 + 좋아요 (is good)

4. 이것**은** 책이에요.
   - Translation: This is a book. / As for this, (it) is a book.
   - Breakdown: 이것 (this-consonant) + 은 + 책이에요 (is a book)

5. 제 친구**는** 한국 사람이에요.
   - Translation: My friend is Korean. / As for my friend, (he/she) is Korean.
   - Breakdown: 제 친구 (my friend-vowel) + 는 + 한국 사람이에요 (is a Korean person)

### When to Use 은/는:

✓ **Known/old information** - already established
✓ **General statements** - "As for X..."
✓ **Contrast** - "X is... (but Y is...)"
✓ **Setting the topic** of conversation

---

## The BIG Difference: 이/가 vs 은/는

### Key Concept:

- **이/가** = Subject marker (NEW info, emphasis, answers "who/what")
- **은/는** = Topic marker (OLD info, general statements, contrast)

### Compare These:

1. **비가 와요.** (It's raining - NEW information, emphasis on rain)
   - Use when announcing it started raining

2. **비는 와요.** (The rain is coming - contrasting with something else)
   - Use when contrasting: "The rain is coming (but the snow isn't)"

### Another Example:

**Q: 누가 학생이에요?** (Who is a student?)
**A: 제가 학생이에요.** (I am [the one who is] a student.) - 가 because answering "who"

**Q: 당신은 뭐예요?** (What are you? / What's your occupation?)
**A: 저는 학생이에요.** (I am a student.) - 는 because "I" is the established topic

### Context Matters:

**Scenario 1: First meeting**
- 저는 대원이에요. (As for me, I'm Daewon - topic introduction)
- 이름이 뭐예요? (What is name? - 이 because asking about NEW unknown subject)

**Scenario 2: Describing weather**
- 오늘 날씨가 좋아요. (Today's weather is good - new observation)
- 날씨는 좋은데 바람이 많아요. (The weather is good, BUT there's a lot of wind - contrast)

## Speaking Practice

### Conversation Prompts (For Native Friend)

Practice these with your Korean friend:

1. **Basic Q&A**:
   - Ask her: "이름이 뭐예요?" (What's your name?)
   - She will answer, then you respond about yourself
   - Practice the difference between question (이) and answer (는)

2. **Describing Things**:
   - Point to objects and ask: "이것이 뭐예요?" (What's this?)
   - Listen to her answer patterns
   - Describe things you see using 이/가

3. **Topic Setting**:
   - Start sentences with "한국은..." (As for Korea...)
   - Ask her to tell you things about Korea
   - Practice using 은/는 for general statements

### Pronunciation Focus

Pay attention to:
- **Particle pronunciation**: 이/가/은/는 are pronounced quickly, not emphasized
- **Natural flow**: Particles blend with the previous word
- **Intonation**: Questions go up at the end (예요? vs 예요.)

---

## Listening Practice

### Exercise: Particle Recognition

Listen to your podcast today and try to:
- Catch any uses of 이/가/은/는
- Count how many times you hear each
- Notice if they're used for questions vs statements

**Reflection**:
- How many 이/가 did you hear? _______
- How many 은/는 did you hear? _______
- Which seems more common? _______
- Any patterns you noticed? _______

---

## Cultural Note: The Importance of Context

### Korean is a Context-Heavy Language

Unlike English where "I" is always "I", Korean changes based on:
- Who you're talking to
- What's already been said
- What's NEW vs OLD information

The particle system helps Korean speakers organize information efficiently. Once something is established as the topic (은/는), you don't need to repeat it constantly - the context carries it.

### Example in Conversation:

**A**: 어제 뭐 했어요? (What did you do yesterday?)
**B**: 친구**를** 만났어요. 친구**는** 학생이에요. 재미있었어요!

Notice how:
- First mention: 친구를 (object marker) - NEW info
- Second mention: 친구는 (topic marker) - now ESTABLISHED, giving more info about friend
- Third sentence: No subject at all! (context makes it clear it's still about meeting the friend)
